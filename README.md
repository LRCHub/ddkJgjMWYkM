[00:00.02] Yeah, I like a little vodka in my Red Bull
[00:02.89] I like a little splash, little coke in my jack
[00:25.89] 
[00:12.27] I like a little curve in my two lane
[00:15.25] I like a little hank with my seat laid back
[00:18.24] I like a little dirt on my tread, little bare in the bed
[00:21.71] My hometown main street drive
[00:24.55] I like dropping the plow, shuttin' it down
[00:27.80] When Friday night rolls around
[00:42.80] 
[00:30.28] Yeah, I like a little vodka in my Red Bull
[00:32.97] I like a little splash, little coke in my jack
[00:36.18] I like a little bank when I shoot pool
[00:38.94] Like to smoke a little smoke with the boys out back
[01:04.44] 
[00:41.88] But when my needle in the hay says she wanna go
[00:44.82] I hit the road like, baby, what you wanna do?
[00:47.95] I like a little bit of this and a little bit of that
[00:51.76] But baby, I love a lotta bit of you, yeah
[01:12.26] 
[01:00.21] I like the little curves in your blue jeans
[01:03.25] Like your little moves when you're out on the floor
[01:06.35] Like that little look that you give when you're 'bout ready to dip
[01:09.73] Baby, slip on out the back door
[01:25.23] 
[01:12.18] Yeah, I like a little vodka in my Red Bull
[01:15.24] I like a little splash, little coke in my jack
[01:18.29] I like a little bank when I shoot pool
[01:21.02] Like to smoke a little smoke with the boys out back
[01:46.52] 
[01:23.84] But when my needle in the hay says she wanna go
[01:26.68] I hit the road like, baby, what you wanna do?
[01:30.65] I like a little bit of this and a little bit of that
[01:33.83] But baby, I love a lotta bit of you
[01:51.33] 
[01:36.23] A lotta bit of you lovin' up on me
[01:39.18] A lotta bit of you seven days a week
[01:41.95] A lotta bit of you, little bit won't do
[01:45.25] Baby, I love, oh, I love a lotta bit of you
[02:06.75] 
[02:00.27] Yeah, I like a little vodka in my Red Bull
[02:03.22] I like a little splash, little coke in my jack
[02:06.01] I like a little bank when I shoot pool
[02:09.11] Like to smoke a little smoke with the boys out back
[02:34.61] 
[02:11.74] But when my needle in the hay says she wanna go
[02:14.86] I hit the road like, baby, what you wanna do?
[02:18.22] I like a little bit of this and a little bit of that
[02:21.82] But baby, I love a lotta bit of you, yeah
